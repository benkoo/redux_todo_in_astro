# Multi-Panel Design System for Interactive Multimedia & Chat

## Design Philosophy

A reusable multimedia-chat interface should be:

    Content-agnostic (supports images, video, 3D models, documents)

    Collaboration-first with real-time interaction capabilities

    Context-aware of media types and workflows

    Conversation-integrated (chat tied to content)

    Cross-platform consistent across devices

# Panel Architecture
## Core Panel Types

    Media Workspace (Primary)

        Central canvas for media interaction

        Supports layered editing/preview

        Multiple tabbed workspaces

    Conversation Hub (Secondary)

        Threaded chat with media annotations

        Collaborative cursor/pointer sharing

        Context-aware suggestion panel

    Asset Navigator (Secondary)

        Unified media library (local/cloud)

        Version history timeline

        Metadata inspector

    Tool Orchestrator (Utility)

        Adaptive editing tools palette

        AI-assisted quick actions

        Session participants roster
