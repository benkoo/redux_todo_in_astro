# Resizable Panel Development Template Plan

## Abstract Specification
- **Context**: Define the problem space and the boundaries for the resizable panel.
- **Goal**: Outline the desired outcomes, such as user interface flexibility and adaptability.
- **Success Criteria**: Specify measurable conditions for successful implementation, like responsiveness and cross-browser compatibility.

## Concrete Implementation
- **Inputs**: List the resources and tools required, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript libraries.
- **Process**: Describe the sequence of development activities, including:
  - Designing the panel structure using HTML and CSS.
  - Implementing resizing logic with JavaScript.
  - Ensuring accessibility and usability.
- **Outputs**: Identify the tangible results, such as a functional prototype and user feedback.

## Realistic Expectations
- **Practical Boundaries**: Define constraints like browser support and performance limits.
- **Evaluation Data**: Detail the data to be collected for assessing functionality, such as user interaction metrics.
- **Validated Cases/Feedback Loops**: Establish mechanisms to incorporate feedback and iterate on the design.

## Integration with CLM
- **Abstract-Concrete Plane**: Map high-level specifications to implementations.
- **Abstract-Balanced Plane**: Link specifications with expected behaviors.
- **Concrete-Balanced Plane**: Connect implementations with outcomes.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Design Phase**
   - Create wireframes and mockups.
   - Define user stories and scenarios.

2. **Development Phase**
   - Set up the development environment.
   - Implement the panel using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   - Test for responsiveness and cross-browser compatibility.

3. **Testing and Validation**
   - Conduct usability testing.
   - Collect and analyze user feedback.
   - Iterate based on findings.

4. **Deployment**
   - Prepare production-ready code.
   - Deploy to the desired platform.
   - Monitor performance and user satisfaction.

## Conclusion
Summarize the development process and highlight the benefits of using the CLM framework for creating a resizable panel.
