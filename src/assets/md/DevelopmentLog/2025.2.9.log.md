## Insights Gained
### 1. Fabric
Fabric is an open-source framework that enhances human capabilities through AI. By leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), Fabric allows us to generate precise and contextually relevant text outputs. This capability is crucial for articulating the design and implementation details of the resizable panel, ensuring clarity and comprehensiveness in our planning. Fabric will be used to automate and refine the documentation process, providing us with precise and detailed design specifications.

### 2. Cubical Logic Model (CLM)
The Cubical Logic Model provides a structured approach to system design by defining three critical dimensions: Abstract Specification, Concrete Implementation, and Realistic Expectations. This model ensures that our logical assumptions, operational realities, and validation criteria are cohesively integrated, offering a robust framework for the panel's development. CLM will guide our design process, ensuring that each phase of development is aligned with our overall objectives.

## Creating a Better Plan Using Our Insights

We are developing a comprehensive plan for implementing a resizable panel that supports both horizontal and vertical adjustments.

To formulate this plan, we will utilize Fabric to generate detailed design and implementation documents, ensuring that all aspects of the panel's functionality are thoroughly considered. Fabric's AI-driven capabilities will enhance our ability to articulate complex design elements clearly.

For structuring the plan, we will employ the Cubical Logic Model to guide us in defining the key dimensions of the project. This model will help us maintain a cohesive integration of all components, providing a robust framework for the panel's development. By using CLM, we ensure that our design is not only theoretically sound but also practically viable.

By integrating Fabric and the Cubical Logic Model, we aim to achieve a robust, scalable, and efficient implementation of the resizable panel plan, enhancing user interaction and adaptability. This integration will allow us to create a user-friendly interface that meets the needs of our users while maintaining high standards of design and functionality.

In conclusion, the combination of Fabric and CLM provides us with a powerful toolkit for developing a resizable panel that is both innovative and practical. By leveraging these insights, we are well-positioned to deliver a solution that exceeds expectations and sets a new standard for user interface design.
