# Resizable Panel Implementation Plan V2

## Overview

Current implementation provides a nested panel system using `react-resizable-panels` with alternating vertical/horizontal layouts. The system consists of:
1. A React-based resizable panel component with recursive nested panel support
2. Dynamic panel loading through DynamicPanel component
3. Configurable panel sizes and constraints
4. Alternating panel orientations based on depth
5. Independent resize handles for nested panels

## 1. Core Components

### 1.1 ResizablePanel Component (ResizablePanel.tsx)
```typescript
const DEFAULT_COMPONENTS = [
  'DemoMainPanel',
  ['SearchAndTodos',
    ['DemoLeftPanel', 'DemoRightPanel'], 
    ['DemoRightPanel', 'DemoRightPanel'],
    'DemoRightPanel'
  ],

];
