## Plan
1. Make Dictionary Panels.json (is the one that contain panel type and component)
2. import the dictionary into PanelGroupLayout.jsx (this is for making the code simplier without import the panel directly into PanelGroupLayout.jsx, just import the library and use it)
3. Simplier the code## Plan

1. **Create `Dictionary Panels.json`:**
   - This JSON file will serve as a centralized repository for defining all panel types and their corresponding components. It will help in maintaining consistency across different parts of the application by ensuring that all panel configurations are stored in one place.
   - Steps to create:
     - Identify all panel types and their components currently used in the application.
     - Structure the JSON file to include keys for each panel type, with nested objects or arrays for their components.
     - Validate the JSON structure to ensure it is correctly formatted and easily readable.
