# Architecture Decisions

## Overview

This project implements a ToDo-based workflow system using functional programming principles, powered by Redux and Astro. Built as a Progressive Web App (PWA), it serves as a reference implementation for event-driven, state-managed applications with a focus on pure functions and immutable state transformations.

The architecture follows a REPL-driven development model, where each workflow step is represented as an atomic ToDo item that can be individually monitored, tested, and verified. The application leverages Redux for predictable state management, Redux Thunk for complex asynchronous operations, and Redux Saga for event-driven workflows.

Key architectural decisions include:
- Functional programming paradigm with pure functions and immutable state
- Event-sourced workflow management using Redux actions
- Hash-referenced configuration system for workflow definitions
- REPL-based development and testing workflow
- Static site generation with Astro for optimal performance
- React components for interactive UI elements
- LangChain integration for AI-powered workflow assistance

The system is designed as a self-contained data store, mirroring distributed operating system principles through event sourcing and state management. All components are implemented following functional programming best practices and Astro framework conventions, ensuring maintainability, testability, and scalability.

## I. Foundational Philosophy: Pure Functions and Declarative Programming

Our architecture is deeply rooted in functional programming principles, viewing the application as a composition of pure functions that transform state in a predictable manner. This approach aligns naturally with both Redux's state management and Astro's component model.

### 1. Pure Function Architecture

The entire application is conceptualized as a pure function that takes the current state and an action as input, producing a new state as output:

```typescript
type AppFunction = (state: State, action: Action) => State;
```

This fundamental concept manifests throughout our architecture:
- **Redux Reducers**: Pure functions transforming state
- **Component Rendering**: Pure functions mapping state to UI
- **Side Effect Management**: Isolated effects through middleware

### 2. Astro Component Model Integration

Astro's component model naturally aligns with functional programming principles through its slot-based composition:

```astro
// ResizablePanel.astro - Pure Component
---
interface Props {
  defaultSize: number;
  minSize: number;
  id: string;
}

const { defaultSize = 30, minSize = 20, id } = Astro.props;
---
<aside 
  id={id}
  style={`flex: ${defaultSize}%; min-width: ${minSize}%`} 
  class="h-full overflow-hidden"
  x-data={`{ 
    size: ${defaultSize},
    resize(newSize) {
      this.size = Math.max(${minSize}, Math.min(newSize, 100 - ${minSize}));
    }
  }`}
>
  <slot />
</aside>
```

This approach provides:
- **Pure Component Logic**: Components as pure functions of their props
- **Declarative Composition**: Slot-based content injection
- **Isolated Side Effects**: Clear boundaries for effects

## II. State Management Architecture

### 1. State Domain Separation Through Functional Composition

```typescript
interface RootState {
  core: {
    layout: LayoutState;
    theme: ThemeState;
    user: UserState;
  };
  features: {
    todos: TodoState;
    documents: DocumentState;
    media: MediaState;
  };
  ui: {
    panels: PanelState[];
    activePanel: string;
    savedLayouts: Record<string, PanelState[]>;
  };
}

// Pure state transformations through composition
const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  core: coreReducer,
  features: featureReducer,
  ui: uiReducer
});
```

### 2. Panel System State Management

```typescript
// Panel Registration System
interface PanelDefinition {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  contentTypes: string[];
  component: React.ComponentType<PanelProps>;
  defaultConfig: PanelConfig;
}

// Panel State Management
interface PanelState {
  readonly id: string;
  readonly type: PanelType;
  readonly content: unknown;
  readonly position: Position;
  readonly config: PanelConfig;
}

// Pure Panel Operations
const panelOperations = {
  resize: (state: PanelState, size: Size): PanelState => ({
    ...state,
    position: { ...state.position, size }
  }),
  
  move: (state: PanelState, point: Point): PanelState => ({
    ...state,
    position: { ...state.position, point }
  }),
  
  update: (state: PanelState, content: unknown): PanelState => ({
    ...state,
    content
  })
};
```

## III. The REPL Pattern and Redux Loop

Our architecture embraces the Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) pattern, which aligns perfectly with Redux's state management cycle:

### 1. Core REPL Cycle

```typescript
interface REPLCycle<S, A> {
  read: () => A;                     // Action creators
  eval: (state: S, action: A) => S;  // Reducers
  print: (state: S) => void;         // UI rendering
  loop: () => void;                  // Next cycle
}

// Implementation in Redux terms
const createREPLStore = <S, A>(
  initialState: S,
  reducer: (state: S, action: A) => S
) => {
  let currentState = initialState;
  
  return {
    read: () => ({ type: 'READ' as const }),
    eval: (action: A) => {
      currentState = reducer(currentState, action);
      return currentState;
    },
    print: () => renderUI(currentState),
    loop: () => requestAnimationFrame(tick)
  };
};
```

### 2. Side Effect Management

```typescript
// Effect description type
interface Effect<T> {
  type: string;
  payload: T;
  execute: () => Promise<void>;
}

// Pure effect creator
const createEffect = <T>(type: string, payload: T): Effect<T> => ({
  type,
  payload,
  execute: async () => {
    // Effect implementation
  }
});

// Effect middleware
const effectMiddleware = (store: Store) => (next: Dispatch) => (action: Action) => {
  const result = next(action);
  if (isEffect(action)) {
    action.execute().then(
      () => store.dispatch(effectSuccess(action)),
      error => store.dispatch(effectFailure(action, error))
    );
  }
  return result;
};
```

## IV. Panel Implementation Architecture

### 1. Layout System Abstraction

```typescript
// Layout Manager Interface
interface LayoutManager {
  createLayout: (type: LayoutType, config: LayoutConfig) => Layout;
  addPanel: (panel: PanelDefinition, position?: Position) => void;
  removePanel: (panelId: string) => void;
  resizePanel: (panelId: string, dimensions: Dimensions) => void;
  serializeLayout: () => LayoutState;
  deserializeLayout: (state: LayoutState) => void;
}

// Panel Group Implementation
interface PanelGroup {
  readonly id: string;
  readonly panels: ReadonlyArray<Panel>;
  readonly layout: Layout;
  
  addPanel: (panel: Panel) => PanelGroup;
  removePanel: (id: string) => PanelGroup;
  updatePanel: (id: string, updates: Partial<Panel>) => PanelGroup;
}
```

### 2. Focus Management Integration

```typescript
// Focus Management System
interface FocusManager {
  currentFocusedPanel: string | null;
  
  getFocusableElements(panel: HTMLElement): HTMLElement[];
  moveFocusToNextPanel(currentPanelId: string): void;
  trapFocus(panel: HTMLElement): void;
}

// Focus-Aware Panel Component
interface FocusAwarePanelProps {
  id: string;
  children: React.ReactNode;
}

const FocusAwarePanel: React.FC<FocusAwarePanelProps> = ({ id, children }) => {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  const activePanelId = useSelector((state: RootState) => state.focus.activePanelId);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    if (activePanelId === id) {
      const panel = document.getElementById(id);
      if (panel) {
        setupFocusTrap(panel);
      }
    }
  }, [id, activePanelId]);
  
  return (
    <div 
      id={id}
      role="region"
      tabIndex={-1}
      aria-label={`Panel ${id}`}
    >
      {children}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### 3. Drag and Drop Integration

```typescript
// DnD State Management
interface DragState {
  isDragging: boolean;
  sourceId: string | null;
  targetId: string | null;
  itemType: string | null;
  item: any;
  position: { x: number; y: number } | null;
}

// Draggable Panel Component
const DraggablePanel: React.FC<DraggablePanelProps> = ({
  id,
  children,
  dragType,
  dragData
}) => {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  
  const [{ opacity }, dragRef] = useDrag({
    type: dragType,
    item: () => {
      dispatch(dndSlice.actions.dragStart({
        sourceId: id,
        itemType: dragType,
        item: dragData
      }));
      return { id, type: dragType, data: dragData };
    },
    collect: (monitor) => ({
      opacity: monitor.isDragging() ? 0.5 : 1
    })
  });

  return (
    <FocusAwarePanel id={id}>
      <div ref={dragRef} style={{ opacity }}>
        {children}
      </div>
    </FocusAwarePanel>
  );
};
```

## V. Performance Optimizations

### 1. State Updates
```typescript
// Optimized state transitions
const createOptimizedReducer = <S, A>(
  handlers: Record<string, (state: S, action: A) => S>
) => {
  const memoizedHandlers = new Map();
  
  return (state: S, action: A): S => {
    const handler = handlers[action.type];
    if (!handler) return state;
    
    const key = JSON.stringify(action);
    if (memoizedHandlers.has(key)) {
      return memoizedHandlers.get(key)(state);
    }
    
    const result = handler(state, action);
    memoizedHandlers.set(key, () => result);
    return result;
  };
};
```

### 2. Component Optimizations
```typescript
// Memoized panel component
const MemoizedPanel = memo(Panel, (prev, next) => {
  return (
    prev.id === next.id &&
    prev.size === next.size &&
    prev.content === next.content
  );
});

// Selective rendering
const usePanelRenderer = (panelId: string) => {
  const panel = useSelector(
    (state: RootState) => state.panels[panelId],
    shallowEqual
  );
  
  return useMemo(
    () => <PanelContent content={panel.content} />,
    [panel.content]
  );
};
```
