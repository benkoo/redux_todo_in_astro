[Latent Dirichlet Allocation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation) ([[LDA]]) is a generative statistical model that is used to discover abstract topics within a collection of documents. It was introduced by David Blei, [[Andrew Ng]], and Michael I. Jordan in 2003 and has since become one of the foundational techniques in topic modeling within the field of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning.

The core idea behind LDA is that documents are composed of a mixture of topics, where a topic is defined as a distribution over a fixed vocabulary. These topics are not observed (hence, "latent"), but can be inferred from the observed words in the documents. LDA assumes the following generative process for each document in a corpus:

1. **Choose a distribution over topics:** Each document is assumed to be generated by first choosing a distribution over topics. This distribution is drawn from a [[Dirichlet distribution]], which is a family of continuous multivariate probability distributions parameterized by a vector of positive reals.
    
2. **Generate words from topics:** For each word in the document, a topic is chosen from the document's distribution over topics. Then, a word is chosen from the corresponding topic's distribution over words. This step is repeated for each word in the document.
    

The [[Dirichlet distribution]] is crucial in this model because it allows for a wide range of variability in the distribution of topics within documents. Some documents may be heavily focused on a small number of topics, while others may cover a broader range of topics.

The key output of LDA is the set of topics (each represented as a distribution over words) that best explains the set of documents in the corpus. Additionally, LDA provides a topic distribution for each document, indicating the proportion of each topic present in that document. These outputs make LDA a powerful tool for understanding the underlying thematic structure of a large corpus of text data.

LDA has been applied in various domains such as **identifying thematic patterns in scientific literature**, analyzing customer feedback, and organizing large collections of documents by topic. Its flexibility and unsupervised nature, requiring no prior labeling of documents with topics, make it particularly appealing for exploratory data analysis in text mining tasks.

Maybe we should also check out the concept of [[Extreme Statistics]] in the context of [[Latent Dirichlet Allocation]]. It is also based on [[Bayesian inference]] or [[Bayesian Statistics]]. Also see [[Modular Cluster]].
